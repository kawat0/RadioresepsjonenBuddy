# RadioresepsjonenBuddy

## What?

RadioresepsjonenBuddy is a very simple Chrome Extension that lists the
latest 7 podcasts from http://podkast.nrk.no/program/radioresepsjonen.rss.
The popup.js uses the google Feeds API to parse the RSS feed. Which is then appended to popup.html.

## Why?

Being a very frequent RR-listener, I have always wanted a simple way to
check for new RR podcasts, and or quickly open/download existing ones.
Using a podcast-organizer is something I do practice on the phone, but not
whilst at my workplace computer.

## Features

- Updated list of the newest RR podcasts.
- Should open a new media-tab when clicked. (Not tested with other environments other than my own)
- Beautifully styled with Bootstrap. (Yes, I smacked the entire .css file in there even though I only need like 10 properties. I might optimize later.)

## Disclaimer

This would be my first chromium extension, so things wont be perfect. New features might come with later iterations.
